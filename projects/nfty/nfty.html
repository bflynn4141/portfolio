			<h2>What is NFTY News?</h2>
			<p><span><a href="http://nfty.news/">NFTY News</a></span> is a non-fungible token and decentralized applications newsletter covering current news and trends. The newsletter seeks to experiment with new forms of incentive mechanisms to support creative content that couldn't be done without blockchain.
			<br></br>
			Artists can now tokenize their own artwork and sell it on the blockchain and receive royalty fees every time it's re-sold. Fans can invest in content creators and receive rewards for backing them early through mechanisms like bonding curves.
			</p>
			<h1>Why NFTY News is an important project</h1>
			<p>I started the newsletter back in March 2018 because I saw a new trend emerging - the rise of digital goods. Anyone can become their own manufacturer and distributor by providing some cost of goods sold in the form of gas (Ethereum).
			<br></br>
			At the time I was looking for a way to break into the crypto industry. I didn't know how to code, I wasn't some insane quant, and I wasn't planning on it and the time. I had two things going for me: 1) I liked design and 2) I knew how to write.
			<br></br>
			I knew I needed to build a reputation in order to have a qualified opinion on some matters. I started a 6 month growth plan. I could highlight existing news in the space, find signal within the noise, and become a trusted name. As I started down this path, I received complaints and offerings to try and get products in the newsletter for paid offerings.
			<br></br>
			I declined. I knew from the beginning I had to sacrifice pay for reputation. I had no income for 4 months but needed a way to pay rent. I kept blogging, tweeting, and engaging with the community. Eventually, I started becoming a "thought leader" with no previous experience. The biggest investors in the space started listening to me, even though I had no background.
			<br></br>
			I came up with original thoughts and novel experiments to keep things interesting. My newsletter was called "Not-So-Fungible-Weekly" and I paid a different artist $50 each week to design a "newsletter cover" for my blog. The cover would be tokenized, and I would sell ten prints each week. The donation was split between myself and the artist 80/20.</p>

			<p>This rapid experimentation and original thinking has led me to receive multiple requests from companies within the industry for advising and consulting positions. I've never had any of these sorts of positions before, but I learned how to play many different hats including: event organizer, UX designer, product manager, community manager, and business development.</p>
